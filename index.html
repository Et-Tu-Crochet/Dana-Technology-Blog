    <h3>Dana's Blog - Winter 2021</h3>
    <p>Building a website is perfect for developing coding skills.</p>
    <p><b>January 9, 2022</b></p>
    <p>App designers as well as website designers focus to provide a service that 
        has a function to suit the clients needs and is visually accessible. </p>
    <p><b>January 10, 2021</b></p>
    <p>Writing concise code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript differ from creating a Windows Form Application
        in C# as you are only using code to write and design the site. There is no form to drag, drop, or create on. 
        All design is from the code alone.
